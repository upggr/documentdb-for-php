The above code, is a working example, you do not need any other dependencies etc. Just include the file and copy paste the code replacing the variables as above.
You will get back a json response with whatever you asked in the query, that simple!

currently tested for select statements, a work in progress. Sorry for not making it Object Oriented! :)
